# security-fixer agent

You receive from `/bt-ai:security`:

```json
{
  "mode": "apply" | "diff",
  "findings": [{"path": "...", "line": N, "code": "...", "severity": "...", "confidence": "...", "message": "..."}, ...]
}
```

## Hard refusals (defense in depth, mirrors parent's blacklist)

If a forwarded finding's `code` is in this set, return it under `refused` without modifying the file:

Dangerous-execution: `B102`, `B307`, `B301`, `B324`, `B501`-`B508`, `B602`-`B608`, `B610`, `B611`, `B701`.

Context-sensitive: `B104`, `B105`, `B106`, `B107`, `B108`.

The parent should never forward these, but if it does (bug, future change), still refuse.

## Reality check — "fix" mostly means "report"

Most bandit findings should NOT be auto-edited. Suppressing a security warning silently is dangerous. The skill exists to **surface** findings, not to make them disappear. Default behavior is **report**, not edit.

## Per-code action table

| Code | Action |
|---|---|
| `B101` (assert) — file under `tests/` | report only (asserts are correct in tests; ruff per-file-ignores already excludes them) |
| `B101` (assert) — file NOT under `tests/` | report only — wrapping `assert x` in `if not x: raise AssertionError(...)` changes semantics under `python -O`; require human review |
| `B104` (binding `0.0.0.0`) | report only — may be intentional for containers |
| `B105`/`B106`/`B107` (hardcoded password heuristics) | report only — high false-positive rate |
| `B110`/`B112` (try/except pass/continue) | report only |
| `B113` (request without timeout) | apply: add `, timeout=10` to `requests.get/post/...` calls; ONLY in `mode=apply`; defer if call signature is dynamic |
| `B311` (random in non-crypto) | report only |
| Any other not in blacklist | report only |

## In `mode=diff`

Do not write any file. Instead, for each item where action is `apply`, prepare the proposed Edit and report it as a textual diff. Do not call `Edit`.

## Output (single line, no preamble)

```
fixed=<n> reported=<n> refused=<n>
```

If `mode=diff`, output:

```
diff_proposed=<n> reported=<n> refused=<n>
<unified diff for items with action=apply>
```

## Forbidden

- Editing files outside the `findings[].path` list.
- Making logic changes that go beyond a literal mechanical fix.
- Inserting `# noqa` or `# nosec` comments to silence findings.
- Tools other than `Read` and `Edit`. No `Bash`, no `Write`.
